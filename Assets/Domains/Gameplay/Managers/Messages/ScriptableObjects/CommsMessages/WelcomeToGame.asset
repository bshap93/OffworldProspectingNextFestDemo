  commsMessageRawBodyText: "Congratulations and welcome to your new prospect! We
    hope your pre-fabricated BrightHope(TM) mobile prospecting outpost is to your
    liking. We are pleased to have you as our eighth customer here on L 98-59 b.
    \n\nYour outpost was built on top of an older outpost of a grandfather-era terraforming
    operation. Of course, that terraforming did change the landscape quite a bit,
    and anything of theirs is now below the new surface of the planet. \n\nYou're
    here to dig and find any artifacts from and investigate any signals that might
    promise grandfather-era tech, and of course, mine for resources. We will happily
    compensate you for each artifact and of course pay you for the valuable items
    you mine. \n"
